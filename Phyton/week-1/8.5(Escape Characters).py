# Escape Character
# To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
# An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

# The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
