# 1. There are three numeric types in Python:

int
float
complex

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex always has "j"

# Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.

# 2. Random Number
# Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))
